The TheDimensionsOfSHA.pdf paper is a review of the workings of the Secure Hash Algorithm, developed by the U. S. National Security Agency.  The SHA is a variant of the general hash method and is, in and of itself, a remarkable achievement. As the paper discusses, the SHA has a number of "dimensions", or aspects, of it's design that can render SHA encryption uncrackable.

By way of example, anyone can download a copy of TheDimensionsOfSHA.pdf, deposit it somewhere else and claim it as their own.  They can even generate their own hash signature for it.  But this is where a good repository service comes in -- like GitHub.  The repo's timestamp.  Any copy and transfer would be timestamped later than this repo.  And the author can claim original authorship because I can show any tribunal that only I can produce the plaintext key that can produce the SHA hash.

But, you say, they could make minor changes to the document and claim original authorship.  1) I used a non-modifiable PDF format; making changes would be daunting -- is it worth it?  2) make *any* change and my Document Signature will not match.  The thief would have to make their own.  But after all that effort they still have the timestamp problem; they cannot claim that I'm the thief of their work, but I could make a case for the reverse.
